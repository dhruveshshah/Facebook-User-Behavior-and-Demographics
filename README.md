# Facebook-User-Behavior-and-Demographics
The goal of this project is to understand the facebook users behavior and demographics.
The dataset contains 99000 observations each representing a user and has different user information.
The dataset can be obtained from udacity website. 
I have performed exploratory data analysis and examined relation between multivariate data by creating histograms, frequency polygons and box plot to understand user behavior and demographics.
